                one of the core philosophies of our organisation. We never have and never will commercially exploit such
                information by selling it to third parties. We share customer information only as described below, and
                in no other manner:</span><br><br>

            <span class="content-text-bold">1) Third-party service providers</span><br>

            <span class="content-text">We employ other companies and individuals to perform some functions on our

                Use and other agreements; or protect the rights, property or safety of The Souled Store, our users or
                others. This includes exchanging information with other companies, organisations, government or

                of any merger, acquisition, debt financing, sale of company assets, or similar transaction, as well as
                in the event of an insolvency, bankruptcy, or receivership in which all such information is transferred
                to one or more third parties as one of our business assets.</span><br>
